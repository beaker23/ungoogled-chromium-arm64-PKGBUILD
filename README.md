# ungoogled-chromium-arm64
PKGBUILD and associated files to compile Ungoogled Chromium on Arch Linux ARM 64-bit

Package compiles using an Odroid-N2 with 4GB of RAM and an 8GiB SWAP partition, using a 32GB eMMC module.

Failure to create a SWAP partition of a sufficient size will cause compilation to fail if compiling from an Odroid-N2.
